# Data Science Group 7 Project

In this repository you will find the work of Group 7 of the CS405/605-01 Fall 2023 class.

Group 7 is:
Leena Godbole
Ege Keser
Mawuli Agboklu
Andrew Van Es
William Harper

The work is divided into different stages. As of now, only Stage 1 is complete, but the work in each stage will be added to new folders as it is completed. 
Within each stage, there is group work and individual work. Deliverables for the group task will be named in a way that will describe it as group work, or otherwise have the name of who worked on it in the title.
